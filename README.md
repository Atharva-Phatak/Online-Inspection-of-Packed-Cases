Online Inspection of Packed Cases

Leaves of Crops are threshed and are packed into cases,these packed cases are then inspected for Conformity to approve in terms of:
1.Color
2.Ripeness
3.Uniformity

So,here I develop three separate algorithms which imitate Color,Ripeness and Uniformity inspection while keeping the processing time for each of the algorithm under one minute.
Calculate Moments: mean_H,mean_S,mean_V,stddev_H,stddev_S,stddev_V,entropy_H,entropy_S,entropy_V,Skew_H,Skew_S,Skew_V,Kurtosis_H,Kurtosis_S,Kurtosis_V
where (H-Hue,S-Saturation,V-Value)
